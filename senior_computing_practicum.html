            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">
                The Good Driver Incentive Program is a web application that encourages better driving behaviors among truck drivers by awarding points for positive actions. These points can be redeemed for products in a sponsor-managed catalog. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Drivers:</strong> can log in to the system, view and update their profiles, track their points, and browse their sponsor's catalog to redeem points for rewards. They can also view the status of their purchases and manage their orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sponsor Users:</strong> oversee the drivers and manage the incentive programs. They can log in to review and update their own profiles, manage driver applications, approve or reject drivers, and adjust points based on driver performance. They also manage the product catalog by integrating with APIs for up-to-date product information, including prices and availability. Sponsors can assume the role of a driver to see the system from the driver's perspective, ensuring the program runs smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Admin Users:</strong> have the highest level of control, managing both sponsor and driver accounts. They can review and update profiles for all user types, handle security aspects like password resets, and monitor significant system events through audit logs. Admins ensure the overall integrity and security of the system by managing access, handling escalations, and generating detailed reports that track points, purchases, and system usage across all users.
