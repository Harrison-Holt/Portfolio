            <h1>Web Accessibility Focus</h1>
            <p>As a developer with personal experience of disability, I am passionate about building accessible and inclusive web applications. 
                My commitment to web accessibility stems from both my academic studies and my desire to ensure that the web is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
            <p>Web accessibility ensures that individuals of all abilities can interact with websites and digital platforms. By prioritizing accessibility, 
                I strive to make sure that everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, can navigate and experience the web comfortably.</p>
            
            <h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
            <p>In July 2006, just a week after my fifth birthday, I started having seizures—at its peak, I was experiencing over a hundred seizures a day. 
                In October 2007, I underwent a <strong>hemispherectomy</strong>, which left me partly paralyzed on the right side of my body, and I lost function in my right arm.
                Over the past 17 years, I’ve faced many challenges where having only one functioning hand made tasks significantly harder. Using tools designed for two hands has been a constant struggle, 
                and these experiences taught me how poorly designed many things are for people with disabilities.</p>
        
            <p>These experiences shaped my determination to make sure no one is excluded in the digital world. After using screen readers myself and encountering extreme difficulties, 
                I couldn’t believe that so many people rely on them as their only means of navigating the web. This realization has driven me to build accessible web applications, ensuring that people with disabilities 
                receive the equitable access they deserve.</p>
        
            <h2>Academic and Project Experience</h2>
            <p>As part of my coursework in <strong>Inclusive Design & Access Tech (HCC-4510)</strong>, I participated in a project where we designed a user-friendly, accessible digital kiosk specifically tailored for 
               the residents of a retirement community. The kiosk aimed to serve as a central hub for information, communication, and entertainment. It was designed with features such as large readable text, simple navigation, 
               and accessibility options to accommodate users with physical, cognitive, or sensory limitations.</p>
        
            <p>My team and I worked directly with elderly individuals with disabilities to understand their specific needs and challenges. We conducted focus groups at the Clemson Downs retirement community to collect user feedback, 
               which greatly informed our design process. This participatory design approach ensured that the kiosk was not only functional but also aligned with the real needs of its users.</p>
        
            <p>The goal of the project was to create a scalable, secure, and accessible system that promotes community engagement. This experience deepened my understanding of accessibility in technology and reinforced my commitment 
               to creating solutions that empower individuals with disabilities.</p>
        
            <p>In the upcoming project, I will be focusing on improving mobility for individuals with disabilities by enhancing driving function, further exploring how assistive technology can provide solutions for people with limited mobility.</p>
        
            <h2>My Commitment</h2>
            <p>My studies in <strong>Inclusive Design & Access Tech (HCC 4510)</strong> and <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (CPSC 4140)</strong> have provided me with a strong foundation in accessibility standards such as <strong>WCAG 2.1</strong>. 
                I aim to implement inclusive design principles in all of my web projects, ensuring that users have seamless, accessible experiences.</p>
