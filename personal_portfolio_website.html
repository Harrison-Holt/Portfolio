                <h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                    A showcase of my journey into web development. This project was my first foray into using HTML and CSS. It's structured to highlight my projects, skills, and experiences, demonstrating the foundational practices of web page layout and design.
                </p>
            
                <h3>My Design Process</h3>
                <p>
                    For my initial portfolio page, I aimed for a clean and minimalist design to show that a simple design can be effective for a webpage. I selected a color palette that reflects this aesthetic, using neutral tones with a few accent colors to create a visually appealing yet simple design:
                    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #70BEBC;"></div><p>#70BEBC (Soft Seafoam)</p>
                    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #F8F4DE;"></div><p>#F8F4DE (Warm Ivory)</p>
                    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #E22728;"></div><p>#E22728 (Vibrant Coral)</p>
                    I used Merriweather and Cardo as fonts to maintain readability and a clean look. One of the challenges I faced was struggling with Bootstrap initially, but I overcame this by practicing and gradually getting comfortable with its components and grid system.
                </p>
        
                <h4>Wireframe and Design Mockup</h4>
                <p>
                    I used Figma to create the wireframe and design mockup for this project. Initially, I planned for a single-page design as seen in my wireframe. However, I realized that the page was becoming too long and cluttered, which led me to add an extra page in my design mockup to improve usability and navigation.
                </p>

                <h4>Color Palette</h4>                                    <h4>Color Palette</h4>
                    <p>The color palette I chose for this project reflects the minimalist aesthetic I aimed for. I selected neutral tones with a few accent colors to create a visually appealing yet simple design:</p>
                    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #70BEBC;"></div><p>#70BEBC (Soft Seafoam)</p>
                    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #F8F4DE;"></div> <p>#F8F4DE (Warm Ivory)</p>
                    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #E22728;"></div> <p>#E22728 (Vibrant Coral)</p>                                
            
                <h3>My Coding Process</h3>
                <h4>Technologies</h4>
                <p>
                    For this first project, I focused on improving my HTML/CSS skills and also learned how to use basic Bootstrap to structure the layout of my page. This project was all about making clean HTML and using semantic code. I learned Bootstrap and how to utilize it for layout with flexboxes, and used CSS transitions and animations. I wanted the design to be simple, not overpowering, and easy to read.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                <p>To ensure that my portfolio is user-friendly and accessible to a wide audience, I conducted usability tests with six participants from diverse backgrounds and age groups. The feedback from these tests helped identify areas for improvement and refine the overall design.</p>
            
                <h4>Participants</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engineering Major (22 years old)</li>
                    <li>Architect (25 years old)</li>
                    <li>Software Developer (36 years old)</li>
                    <li>Retired Doctor (68 years old)</li>
                    <li>Anthropology Major (18 years old)</li>
                    <li>Nurse (55 years old)</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4>Testing Methodology</h4>
                <p>Each participant was asked to complete the following tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find and navigate to a specific project in the portfolio.</li>
                    <li>Describe the design process for one project by locating the provided details.</li>
                    <li>Provide feedback on the overall design, readability, and ease of use.</li>
                </ul>
