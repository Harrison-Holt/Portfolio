                    <h1>My Mission and Vision</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to my digital portfolio, a curated collection of my professional journey, projects, and the skills I've honed along the way. 
                        This portfolio is more than just a showcase of past work; 
                        it's a reflection of my dedication to continuous learning and improvement, my passion for creative problem-solving, and my commitment to excellence.

                         From detailed case studies that explore my approach to tackling complex challenges to snippets of my day-to-day learning, this portfolio is designed to not only display 
                         what I have accomplished but also to ignite conversations about future possibilities. 
                         It is an invitation to connect, explore, and embark on new ventures that push the boundaries of what we can achieve together.</p>

                    <h1>My Journey</h1>
                    <p>  My name is Harrison Holt, and as a senior Computer Science major 
                        with a minor in Psychology, 
                        I am deeply passionate about blending technology with human 
                        behavior to enhance user experiences in digital environments. 
                        My academic journey is complemented by personal interests in
                         running, sports, and history, which have instilled in me the 
                        values of perseverance and an appreciation for the lessons of 
                        the past. Initially hesitant about web design and development, 
                        my perspective shifted as I immersed myself deeper into the field, 
                        growing to love the creativity and problem-solving it entails. 
                        This evolution reflects my broader approach to life and learning: 
                        I am determined, endlessly curious, and thrive when 
                        faced with challenges, always seeking innovative solutions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Collaboration is at the heart of my ethos; 
                        I firmly believe that working together as a group 
                        amplifies our potential beyond what can be achieved 
                        individually. My journey has taught me the importance 
                        of listening to and valuing my peers' opinions, even 
                        when they differ from my own, as this diversity of 
                        thought leads to more robust solutions and personal growth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, my enthusiasm for tackling problems and diving into 
                        new learning opportunities sometimes leads me to take on too much, 
                        stretching my capacity thin. I recognize that my eagerness to solve 
                        challenges and contribute can sometimes overshadow the need for patience 
                        and deeper reflection. Moreover, I am learning to accept that being wrong is 
                        a valuable part of the learning process, helping me to embrace feedback more 
                        openly and use it as a tool for growth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In every endeavor, I strive to leverage my strengths and confront 
                        my weaknesses, aiming to make a meaningful impact through technology 
                        while continuously seeking personal and professional development.</p>
