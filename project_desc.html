                                <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                                    A showcase of my journey into web development. This project was my first foray into using HTML and CSS. It's structured to highlight my projects, skills, and experiences, demonstrating the foundational practices of web page layout and design.
                                </p>
                            
                                <h3>My Design Process</h3>
                                <p>For my initial portfolio page, I aimed for a clean and minimalist design to show that a simple design can be effective for a webpage.</p>
                            
                                <div class="media-row">

                                <h4>Color Palette</h4>
                                <p>The color palette I chose for this project reflects the minimalist aesthetic I aimed for. I selected neutral tones with a few accent colors to create a visually appealing yet simple design:</p>
                                <div class="color-palette">
                                    <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></div>

                                <h4>Technologies</h4>
                                <p>For this first project, I focused on improving my HTML/CSS skills and also learned how to use basic Bootstrap to structure the layout of my page.</p>
                            
                                <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                                <p>To ensure that my portfolio is user-friendly and accessible to a wide audience, I conducted usability tests with six participants from diverse backgrounds and age groups. The feedback from these tests helped identify areas for improvement and refine the overall design.</p>

                            <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                                This Weather Application is designed to provide users with real-time weather forecasts and climate changes. Utilizing Angular for its robust features in building dynamic single-page applications, this project will not only expand my framework proficiency by adding Angular alongside my React skills but also deepen my understanding of working with external APIs and complex data handling. The app aims to feature interactive weather maps, a variety of forecast models, and customized weather alerts to ensure users stay well-informed about their local and global weather conditions. Through this project, I will explore Angular's powerful capabilities and enhance my frontend development expertise.
