            <h3>Interactive Quiz App</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                The Interactive Quiz App is a dynamic web application designed to offer users a fun and engaging way to test their knowledge across various topics. Developed using React.js for efficient state management and Bootstrap for responsive design, this app ensures an interactive and accessible experience on any device.
            </p>
        
            <h3>My Design Process</h3>
            <p>The goal was to create a user-friendly interface that is both engaging and intuitive, minimizing distractions to focus users on quiz content. The layout is designed to guide users through quizzes smoothly without any unnecessary complexity.</p>

            
            <h4>Color Palette</h4>
            <p>The selected color palette is designed to enhance focus and user engagement, using vibrant colors to differentiate between quiz elements and feedback:</p>
            <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #4a76a8;"></div><p>#4a76a8 (Steel Blue): Used for primary interface elements and headers.</p>
            <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #f8f9fa;"></div> <p>#f8f9fa (Cultured): Applied as the background color to provide a clean and subtle canvas.</p>
            <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #007bff;"></div> <p>#007bff (Vivid Blue): Utilized for interactive elements such as buttons and links to draw attention.</p>
            <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #28a745;"></div> <p>#28a745 (Forest Green): Used for correct answers and confirmation messages to signify success.</p>
            <div class="color-swatch" style="background-color: #dc3545;"></div> <p>#dc3545 (Ruby Red): Employed for warnings and incorrect answers to alert users.</p>

            <h3>My Coding Process</h3>
            <h4>Technologies</h4>
            <p>This project provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my expertise in React.js, focusing on component-based architecture to manage the quiz logic and user interactions dynamically. Bootstrap was used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, from smartphones to large desktop displays.</p>
        
            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>Usability tests were conducted with a diverse group of participants to ensure the quiz interface was intuitive and met user expectations. This feedback was integral in refining the user interface to enhance the overall user experience.</p>
            <h4>Participants</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>High School Student (17 years old)</li>
                <li>College Professor (45 years old)</li>
                <li>Software Developer (30 years old)</li>
                <li>Marketing Manager (38 years old)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Participants were asked to complete a set of quizzes, navigate through different categories, and provide feedback on the clarity of the questions and the interface. Adjustments were made based on their inputs to improve the usability and accessibility of the app.</p>
